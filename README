This is the execution code and data for the paper of "Hawkes-Dirichlet Propagated Processes for Continuous Time Interactions"

Please first run MC_0.py to run the algorithm. It will save the result in a npz format. 

Then, calculate_AUC.py and calculate_ll.py can be implemented to calculate the corresponding AUC and Log-Likelihood on testing data.
